<h2>Mini Splits</h2>
<p class="paragraph-content">Mini split systems, otherwise known as ductless HVAC, are energy efficient systems that can service any type of room from workshops to multi-room homes. These systems have indoor air handling units and an outdoor compressor. Control individual room climates to everyone's preference in homes as large as 3,000 square feet or up to 9 zones per outdoor compressor.</p>
<h3>WHY ARE MINI SPLITS A GOOD IDEA?</h3>
<p class="paragraph-content">Mini splits are a great alternative to traditional HVAC with numerous benefits including:
   <ul class="paragraph-content">
        <li>Individualized temperature control for each room</li>
        <li>Heating and cooling capability</li>
        <li>Mountable on wall, floor, or ceiling</li>
        <li>No duct work</li>
        <li>Quick and easy installation</li>
        <li>Energy efficient</li>
        <li>Cost savings</li>
        <li>Quiet systems</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>HOW TO CHOOSE BETWEEN MINI SPLITS OR CENTRAL AIR</h3>
<p class="paragraph-content">Already have duct work installed? The cost of installing central air will most likely be less than that of installing mini splits. However, mini splits are more energy efficient which saves you more on bills compared to central air.

    <p class="paragraph-content">Don't have duct work already installed? The cost of duct work installation will most likely be higher than that of installing mini splits. Depending on your budget and desires, mini splits may be your preferred option.</p>
<div><br/></div>
<p class="paragraph-content">Mini split ductless systems are usually considered for installation in homes or buildings where there is no room for duct work or in rooms such as garages and workshops that don't have access to the central air already installed in a home or building. If you would like to have more control on heating and cooling individual rooms, only want to run one or a few air units at a time, and would like smaller electric bills, mini splits are the way to go.</p>
</p>
<h3>WHICH TYPE OF MINI SPLIT IS RIGHT FOR ME?</h3>
<p class="paragraph-content">Mini splits can be installed on a wall, floor, or ceiling and come in different sizes according to room measurements. <span style="color: #ac1101;">Miller's Services</span> takes into account the environmental factors such as ceiling height, insulation, and climate when recommending the best mini split system for your home or business.</p>
<h3>THE INSTALLATION PROCESS</h3>
<p class="paragraph-content">Installation time depends on how many indoor units are being placed and the size of the building or home, but it's a relatively quick job with a 1 - 2 day turnaround time. </p>
<h3>MINI SPLIT MAINTANANCE</h3>
<p class="paragraph-content">In order for mini split systems to run at its best, it's important to perform regular filter cleanings of the indoor air handling units and outdoor condenser coil cleanings. Good maintenance can prolong the life of your system and prevent them from losing efficiency. Bonus - with a mini split ductless system, there are no ducts to be serviced.
